I am a postdoctoral scholar at Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore ([BEARS](http://bears.berkeley.edu/)) Limited, a UC Berkeley's research centre, in Singapore. I work for the [SinBerBEST 2](http://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/) program (Theme D: Data Analytics for the Built Environment) under [Kameshwar Poolla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kameshwar_Poolla). I did my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT-Delhi, India, under the guidance of [Amarjeet Singh](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~amarjeet/) and [Pushpendra Singh](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~pushpendra/). Before that, I received my Masters degree in computer applications from Madurai Kamaraj University, Tamilnadu, India.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Data Science and Cyber-Physical Systems and their applications to smart buildings and energy sustainability. Specifically, I research on developing systems and methods for energy monitoring, benchmarking, prediction, and anomaly detection by leveraging smart meter and other opportunistic data sources. More recently, I am also investigating how to use Infrared Thermography (IRT) for building diagnostics and characterization at city scale.
